# Big Data Platform for Parliamentary Transparency

## Description

This project aims to provide a big data platform for parliamentary transparency.  
The platform will contain data from the [Moroccan Chamber of Deputies](https://www.chambredesrepresentants.ma/fr/). We are concerned about written questions, oral questions and government engagements.  
We mainly have 3 main tasks to accomplish:

1. Collecting data from the Moroccan Chamber of Deputies website.
2. Implementing a big data infrastucture for data storage and preprocessing.
3. Building a web application or dashboard to visualize data.
